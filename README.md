### **_Description_**

#### Mike's Connect Four is a version of the classic game created by Milton Bradley.

On page load, users are presented with a landing page where they can select a two-player game or to play against the computer. If they choose to play against the computer, they can select Fast mode (player must make selection within 3 seconds [or risk ending game] and computer makes selection within 3 seconds) or Normal mode (no time restriction).

After player makes selection, they are navigated to the game board to where they can pick either red or black pieces. They must press a start button to begin game.
