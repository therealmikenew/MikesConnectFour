### **_Description_**

#### Mike's Connect Four is a version of the classic game created by Milton Bradley.

#### On page load, users are presented with a landing page where they can press a start button to navigate to the game board.

#### The game board defaults to two-player mode. Users can toggle between two-player mode and versus computer mode. The reset board button clears the board and starts the game over, whether in two-player mode or versus computer mode.

#### When a win occurs (four of the same color in a row), a modal pops up declaring the winner and a button will navigate back to the landing page.
