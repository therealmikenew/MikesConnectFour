### **_Description_**

#### Mike's Connect Four is a version of the classic game created by Milton Bradley.

#### On page load, users are presented with a landing page where they can select a two-player game or opt to play against the computer.

#### After selecting either two-player or versus the computer, users can select Fast mode where users must make game moves within a certain amount or time or risk ending the game. If they select Fast mode and also versus the computer, the computer makes selection within a few seconds. In Normal mode (both two-player or versus the computer), there is no time restriction.

#### After the user makes their selections, they are navigated to the game board where they can pick either red or black pieces. They must press a start button to begin game.

#### A scoreboard keeps track of wins. A reset button will empty the game board and reset the score tally. A button will allow users to navigate back to the landing page where they can "start over" and/or make new selections.
